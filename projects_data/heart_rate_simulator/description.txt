Heart rate simulator

Aim of the project was to create a simulator of electric activity of heart. First part of the project concerned a script written firstly in Python, and then in C language, that generated electrophysiological heart signal. Second part was to build a circuit that generates a signal in continuous mode with heart rate adjustable by potentiometer.

Each wave was individually created to introduce noise and versatility. Generated signal was sent by Arduino to Digital-to-Analog converter.
The generated signal was measured on output, by connected oscilloscope. The potentiometer allowed to adjust heart rate. 

Constructed device could be useful during testing ECG equipment. It would be possible to check if it is secure, and how accurate measurement is.
