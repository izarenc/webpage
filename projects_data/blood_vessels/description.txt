Computer modeling of blood vessel tree growth

The purpose of the project was to generate blood vessel trees in the given volume.

The algorithm was implemented in Python with use of SciPy and NumPy libraries. Optimization methods were compared in terms of execution time. Ideas concerning detection of intersections and its removal were analyzed. Impact of those solutions and algorithm paremeters on the tree properties was analysed.

The optimized algorithm detected segment-segment intersection during execution time, not as post processing. Preliminary judgement if segments are close and if intersection checking is justified, made the algorithm much more effective then original.

Implemented functions allowed to generate blood vessel trees inside certain volume stored as binary 3D image. The greater resolution and complexity of the volume the slower the execution is. It is also worth to remark that some regions may not be filled with vessels.

Many features were implemented to improve blood vessel tree generation. The generated blood vessels thanks to algorithm modifications can be used in modelling of flow, because possible errors concerning intersections are avoided.
